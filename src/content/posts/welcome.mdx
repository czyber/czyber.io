# Welcome

This is the inaugural post for this technical blog. It's built with a carefully curated tech stack designed for performance, elegance, and an excellent writing experience.

## Design Philosophy

The design embraces several key principles:

- **Ma (間)** - The Japanese concept of negative space and breathing room
- **Typography First** - Generous line-height (1.75) and thoughtful letter-spacing
- **Restraint** - Sparing use of accent colors for maximum impact
- **Elegance** - Inspired by Vercel's aesthetic with personal touches

## Tech Stack

This blog is built with the latest best practices:

### Core Framework

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 16",
  language: "TypeScript",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS v4",
  components: "Shadcn/ui",
  content: "MDX",
  highlighting: "Shiki via rehype-pretty-code",
  animations: "Framer Motion",
  fonts: "Geist Sans & Geist Mono"
};
```

### Why These Choices?

**Next.js 16** with the App Router provides:
- Server Components by default for optimal performance
- Streaming and Suspense support
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience

**Tailwind CSS v4** introduces:
- CSS-first configuration (no more `tailwind.config.js`)
- Faster build times
- Simpler integration
- Modern CSS features

**MDX** enables:
- Rich content with React components
- Frontmatter for metadata
- Seamless integration with Next.js

## Code Highlighting

The syntax highlighting is powered by Shiki, which provides beautiful, accurate highlighting at build time:

```javascript
// Example: Array methods in JavaScript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);

console.log({ doubled, evens, sum });
```

Here's a Python example:

```python
# Example: List comprehensions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

doubled = [n * 2 for n in numbers]
evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
sum_total = sum(numbers)

print(f"Doubled: {doubled}")
print(f"Evens: {evens}")
print(f"Sum: {sum_total}")
```

And a TypeScript example with interfaces:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "user";
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}! Your role is ${user.role}.`;
}

const currentUser: User = {
  id: "1",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  role: "admin"
};

console.log(greetUser(currentUser));
```

### Line Highlighting

You can highlight specific lines to draw attention to important code. Use the `{lineNumbers}` syntax:

```typescript {2,5-7}
// Regular line
const highlighted = "This line is highlighted!";
const normal = "This is a normal line";

// These three lines are highlighted
const start = "Range start";
const end = "Range end";

const another = "Back to normal";
```

All code blocks include:
- **Copy to clipboard** - One-click copying
- **Language indicator** - Shows the programming language
- **Syntax highlighting** - Powered by Shiki
- **Line highlighting** - Draw attention to key lines
- **Mobile responsive** - Optimized for all screen sizes

## Typography Features

The typography system includes:

1. **Display sizes** - For hero headings (60px, 48px)
2. **Heading hierarchy** - h1 through h4 with proper scaling
3. **Body text** - 18px base size with 1.75 line-height
4. **Generous spacing** - Following the Ma principle

### Lists Work Great

Unordered lists:
- First item with some text
- Second item with more content
- Third item to show spacing

Ordered lists:
1. Research best practices
2. Implement with care
3. Test thoroughly
4. Ship with confidence

## Blockquotes

> "The details are not the details. They make the design."
>
> — Charles Eames

Blockquotes have a subtle accent border and elevated background to stand out without being distracting.

## Links and Emphasis

You can create [links like this](#) that have a subtle underline and transition to the accent color on hover.

Text can be **bold** or *italic* as needed. Inline `code` has a subtle background and the accent color.
